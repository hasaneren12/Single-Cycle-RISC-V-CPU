# Single-Cycle-RISC-V-CPU
The verilog code of a single cycle RISC-V CPU with ALU that has more than 20 instructions.

The single cycle RISC-V CPU has 2 main parts: Datapath and control unit. The both parts are in the verilog project and the instructions that in can execute are given in the control unit. I wrote some instructions in instructions which are multiplication, division, integration, derivation, addition and subtraction. But it can execute more than that. 

It can execute 4 types of intruction sets. They are B-type, R-type, I-type and B type instructions. 

Also if you want to convert the RTL of the CPU to GDS. The config file of the CPU for OpenLane is uploeded too. 

I hope it will help you.
